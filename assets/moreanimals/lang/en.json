    "item-handbooktext-creature-pheasant-*": "Pheasants, Golden pheasants, Capercaillies and Wild Turkeys are raised in the same way that chickens are raised; you can feed them grain from small troughs or alternately feed them by throwing grain or fruit on the ground for them to eat, they won't lay eggs on the ground so either they will use a general purpose nest box to lay their eggs in or they will build their own nest that only their own species can use. Once they have laid three eggs in the nest box a pheasant, golden pheasant or capercaillie hen will then need to incubate the eggs for five days until they hatch. Pheasant, golden pheasant and capercaillie chicks take seven days to mature into poults, and the poults take a further seven days to mature into adults taking two weeks into total to reach maturity.",

    "handbooktitle-henbox": "Use",
    "handbooktext-henbox": "Place nestbox down in a spot your birds have access to, the tooltip for the nestbox will indicate which species can use it, by default this includes chickens, pheasants, golden pheasants, capercaillies and turkeys, but it may support more birds if you have mods that introduce additional birds installed. The birds will prefer to lay eggs in a nestbox if one is available over laying them on the ground. Once the nestbox contains 3 eggs, a broody hen will sit incubating those eggs until they hatch, the eggs can be a mixture from from different species and still be successfully incubated, and the species of hen does not matter for the sake of incubation; the hen does not have to match the species of egg in the nestbox to successfully incubate it.<br><br>For viable eggs, hens must have access to a male of the same species! Hens must be <a href=\"handbook://block-trough-genericwood-small-ns\">well fed</a> to lay! A broody hen needs to have a full belly before it will sit for a day!<br><br>If every nestbox is occupied, hens that want to lay an egg but fail to find an unoccupied, empty nest box will lay their eggs on the ground instead, which can then be picked up. The player can also collect eggs from a henbox, by <hk>rightmouse</hk>-clicking. Eggs that are laid on the ground will never be fertile, cannot be incubated and thus will never hatch.",
